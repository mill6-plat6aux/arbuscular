# Arbuscular

The frivolous API front-end ðŸ˜‚

## Setup

Create `arbuscular.yaml` at the top level of your Node.js project and write the following.

```yaml
port: 3000
interfaces:
  - contextPath: "example"
    interface: "./open-api.yaml"
    route: "./route.yaml"
    authentication:
      module: "./authentication.js"
      function: "authenticate"
    authorization:
      module: "./authorization.js"
      function: "authorize"
```

* `open-api.yaml` is the OpenAPI definition file in your Node.js project.
  * At least OAuth2 clientCredentials must be defined in `components.securitySchemes`.
* `route.yaml` associates the request URL with the JS module in your Node.js project.
* `authentication.js` is the OAuth authentication implementation in your Node.js project.
* `authenticate` is a function of `authentication.js` and is the logic that performs authentication.
* `authorization.js` is the OAuth authorization implementation in your Node.js project.
* `authorize` is a function of `authorization.js` and is the logic that performs authorization.

`route.yaml` is defined as follows.

```yaml
/users:
  GET:
    module: ./logic/users.js
    function: getUsers
  POST:
    module: ./logic/users.js
    function: addUser
```

Finally, `npm install arbuscular` in your Node.js project and `npx arbuscular` will start the API server on the specified port.
